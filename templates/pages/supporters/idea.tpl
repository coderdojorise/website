					<p>iDEA is a national project that helps you badge your brilliance. Through our series of online challenges and events, you can win career-enhancing badges, unlock new opportunities and, ultimately, gain nationally recognised awards that help you stand out from the crowd.</p>

			<h3>Badge Your Brilliance</h3>
			<p>Discover skills you never knew you had and hone the ones you've already got by taking our online challenges. The challenges are split into four main categories, each with its own series of badges to be won - citizen, worker, maker and entrepreneur. As well as being fun, these badges will help you show off what you've learned and could, when the time comes, help you land the job you want.</p>
