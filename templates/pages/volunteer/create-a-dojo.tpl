			<p>Setting up a CoderDojo is an exciting and straightforward process. If you run into something you can not figure out then email <a href="mailto:startup@coderdojo.london">startup@coderdojo.london</a>. If it looks like inspiring chaos you probably got it right!</p>
			<p>The CoderDojo format is the result of intensive design, development and a lot of real world testing completed by the founders in the original Dojo in Cork, Ireland and refined by volunteers who created their own Dojos in communities and businesses. CoderDojo is an open source learning environment that really delivers.</p>

			<p>CoderDojos are free! Really, <strong>FREE</strong> and there is no central organisation that wants to charge you. It is full of fun and freedom for young people. If you need anything for your CoderDojo go out and ask your local community; its leaders in business and government.</p>

			<h3>Elect your Champion</h3>
			<p>CoderDojo Champions are passionate, driven (not always techie!) volunteers who take charge of setting up, running and maintaining a Dojo.</p>

			<h3>Find your team</h3>
			<p>A Dojo needs a team of volunteers. Usually a mix of technical Mentors and non-technical Volunteers. We recommend at least 3 volunteers for your first Dojo</p>

			<h3>Find your Venue</h3>
			<p>Location is vital for running a successful Dojo. You need a venue with power sockets, internet access, tables and chairs. Try your local community spaces, offices, and co-working spaces. However, you <strong>can not</strong> host Dojos in private residences.</p>

			<h3>Plan your dojo</h3>
			<p>Meet with your team, pick a date and plan the first few sessions. There are lots of learning <a href="/resources">resources</a> available on this website for you to use. You can also create your own if you need something else.</p>

			<h3>Promote your Dojo</h3>
			<p>Setup communications (e.g. email and Twitter) specifically for your Dojo. Consider inviting young people via local schools or youth groups. You can also set up ticketing on the CoderDojo website to know who to expect on the day and ensure they will fit in the venue!</p>

			<h3 class="right">Start Coding</h3>
			<p>Once you have registered and been verified. Put together a plan, make sure your team is prepped and you have a group eager to become CoderDojo Ninjas. Then you are ready to begin the real fun!</p>
